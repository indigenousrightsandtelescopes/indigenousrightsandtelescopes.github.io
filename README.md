We are compiling a list of resources about the issues with indigenous communities and telescopes.

If you want to collaborate with new resources or summarizing one of these, you can do so on [this link!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12yXVlxvAdm1xIQ0NypGA080D3KA32uOqACCNN_dukBI/edit#)

## Articles

* [Science, Culture Clash Over Sacred Mountain](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-mar-18-mn-39418-story.html)

  This article starts with a brief summary of the situation between native Hawaiians and astronomers in Maunakea. Then, it uses testimonies of real native Hawaiians to explain that the issue is not them versus astronomy; they are angry because of the way astronomers have treated their sacred mountain.

* [Decolonising Science Reading List](https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f)

* [What Makes a Volcano Sacred?](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/what-makes-a-volcano-sacred/413203/)

  “The battle for Mauna Kea is ultimately a debate about what is truly sacred, what it means to be human, and who gets to decide.”

* [An Urgent Plea to Fellow Astronomers](https://medium.com/@chanda/an-urgent-plea-to-astronomers-d193d7c0eabe)

  Message to astronomers to reconsider their position and think especially about most likely outcomes from lining up with armed forces against indigenous people.

* [Maunakea, Western Astronomy, and Hawaii](https://astrobites.org/2019/08/02/maunakea-western-astronomy-and-hawaii/)

  An Astrobites article that gives a short overview of the history of the controversy surrounding TMT. My impression is that this is written by astronomers who support indigenous rights. 
  
  This article provides a brief (but well referenced) timeline of the interactions between the astronomy community, the Indigenous Hawaiian groups (the Kānaka Maoli) and Maunakea, giving important historical context to tensions that lead to today’s protests.

* [UBC faculty members join Mauna Kea protesters in calling for the removal of telescope project from Indigenous land](https://www.ubyssey.ca/news/UBC-open-letter-backs-Mauna-Kea-protestors/)

  Article summarising the conflict and stressing the call for a 60-day moratorium from UBC. Also, includes opinions from faculty members asking for stronger actions against TMT from institutions such as UBC.
  
* [A Tale of Two Observatories: Astronomy and Indigenous Communities in the Southwest US](https://astrobites.org/2019/08/16/a-tale-of-two-observatories/)

  An Astrobites article that details the history of interactions between the astronomy community and Indigenous groups at two sites in the United States: the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Mt. Graham International Observatory. It provides examples of both positive and negative conduct and references for further reading. (August 2019)
